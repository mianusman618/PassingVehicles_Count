# PassingVehicles_Count
This repo can be used to analyze traffif passing through a specific region on road. 
This is based on ultralytics library. It uses YOLOv8n to detect objects and then count the objects by using default tracker.
During this implementtaion I faced wrong accuracy related to counts. Which lead me to fix a bug in ultralytics library which is now merged into main branch.
